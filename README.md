# Used Car Price Prediction
 The Used Car Price Prediction project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts the price of a used car based on factors such as its make, model, year, mileage, condition, and location. The model uses data analysis and various algorithms (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, or random forests) to estimate a car's market value. Key steps include data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation. This project helps buyers and sellers assess fair car prices, offering insights into which factors most influence pricing.
